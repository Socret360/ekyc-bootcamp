# provider_demo

A todo list flutter project.

## You Tasks
- have a button to toggle whether to show completed items or not.
- when add todo is pressed, make a request to the server to add todo (make sure that the todos list in provider is up to date)
- do the same thing for delete
- allow user to set a todo as done (again, don't forget to make sure that the todos list in provider is up to date)
